# FlasChat (DISCONTINUED)

FlasChat was my first attempt to create a real time chat.  
It works fine without issues, but I won't use it anymore.  

This is very basic and doesn't have all the security implementations because I knew absolutely nothing about cybersec at that time, now all my newer projects (as of 1 January 2023 if I don't get it wrong) are all created with privacy and security in mind.  
You can still host it but the interface is ugly and it's a bit slow.  

I have a working chat on TINET now bridged through multiple platforms, created from scratch that is much better than this one.  

## Please do not deploy this or open any ports on your router due to the lack of security!!
This could get very dangerous for you!
